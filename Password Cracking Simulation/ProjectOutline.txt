Password Cracking Simulation

Objective: Simulate the procesxs of password cracking using common techniques like brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Language: Python

Key features:

- Simulate the brute force attack by generating all possible character combinations
- Simulate the dictionary attack using a predifined wordlist.
- Include password hashing to simulate how passwords are stored securely.
- Compare the performance of different password cracking techniques.
